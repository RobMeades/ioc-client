/** Urtp class.
 *
 * This class takes in block of Philips I2S protocol samples
 * and encodes them into URTP datagrams.
 *
 * URTP: u-blox real time protocol; encode blocks of
 * audio into simple RTP-like mono audio datagrams.
 *
 * The header looks like this:
 *
 * Byte  |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 *  0    |               Sync byte = 0x5A                |
 *  1    |              Audio coding scheme              |
 *  2    |              Sequence number MSB              |
 *  3    |              Sequence number LSB              |
 *  4    |                Timestamp MSB                  |
 *  5    |                Timestamp byte                 |
 *  6    |                Timestamp byte                 |
 *  7    |                Timestamp byte                 |
 *  8    |                Timestamp byte                 |
 *  9    |                Timestamp byte                 |
 *  10   |                Timestamp byte                 |
 *  11   |                Timestamp LSB                  |
 *  12   |       Number of samples in datagram MSB       |
 *  13   |       Number of samples in datagram LSB       |
 *
 * ...where:
 *
 * - Sync byte is always 0x5A, used to sync a frame over a
 *   streamed connection (e.g. TCP).
 * - Audio coding scheme is one of:
 *   - PCM_SIGNED_16_BIT (0)
 *   - UNICAM_COMPRESSED_8_BIT (1)
 * - Sequence number is a 16 bit sequence number, incremented
 *   on sending of each datagram.
 * - Timestamp is a uSecond timestamp representing the moment
 *   of the start of the audio in this datagram.
 * - Number of bytes to follow is the size of the audio payload
 *   the follows in this datagram.
 *
 * There are two audio coding schemes.  The default, and most
 * efficient, is 8 bit UNICAM compression.  If UNICAM is not
 * used, 16 bit RAW PCM is used.
 *
 * When the audio coding scheme is PCM_SIGNED_16_BIT,
 * the payload is as follows:
 *
 * Byte  |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
 *--------------------------------------------------------
 *  14   |                 Sample 0 MSB                  |
 *  15   |                 Sample 0 LSB                  |
 *  16   |                 Sample 1 MSB                  |
 *  17   |                 Sample 1 LSB                  |
 *       |                     ...                       |
 *  N    |                 Sample M MSB                  |
 *  N+1  |                 Sample M LSB                  |
 *
 * ...where the number of [big-endian] signed 16-bit samples is between
 * 0 and 320, so 5120 bits, plus 112 bits of header, gives
 * an overall data rate of 261.6 kbits/s.
 *
 * When the audio coding scheme is UNICAM_COMPRESSED_8_BIT,
 * the payload is as follows:
 *
 * Byte  |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
 *--------------------------------------------------------
 *  14   |              Block 0, Sample 0                |
 *  15   |              Block 0, Sample 1                |
 *       |                   ...                         |
 *  28   |              Block 0, Sample 14               |
 *  29   |              Block 0, Sample 15               |
 *  30   |     Block 0 shift   |     Block 1 shift       |
 *  31   |              Block 1, Sample 0                |
